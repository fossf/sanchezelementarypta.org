The Sanchez Elementary Parent-Teacher Association is a group of parent and teacher volunteers dedicated to enriching the lives of students, teachers, and families at Sanchez.

## Meetings

We meet on the last Monday of each month, at 8:00am, in the cafeteria.  Come and vote on PTA activities, help us plan events and fundraisers, and learn about volunteer opportunities at Sanchez Elementary.
